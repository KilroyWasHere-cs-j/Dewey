# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv@0.15.1 create --template minimal --types ts --add prettier eslint tailwindcss="plugins:typography,forms" --install npm doctooladmin
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

The backend this admin UI talks to also has a standalone CLI client (`../../cli/main.go`, built as `dewey-cli`) for scripting the same API from a terminal. `list_files` and `list_machines` print as aligned tables; every other command prints indented JSON, colored red on a non-2xx response. See the root [README.md](../../README.md#deployment--packaging) for build/usage details.
